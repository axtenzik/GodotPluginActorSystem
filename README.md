# Godot Actor System

This is a plugin for adding actors and their behaviours into godot

## Plans

Add support for forgetting to set an export, current behaviour is undesired
Add liquid bodies
Add climbing
Add other actor (rigidbody) Nodes
Add more Gravity Nodes
Change how some of the code works, some bits need moving

## Installation

Copy the code into your godot project addons folder

## Usage

When adding a node you can add actor into the scene
Add gravity types for the actor to abide by
Add Actor Components to add functionality to the actor
When adding Nodes, do check for the exports and set them accordingly

## Contributing

I am currently not open to contributions. This code is primarily being made for my own learning benefit. This may change in the future once I get the code to a point where I am happy.

 - A lot of the code is based on this tutorial, this project started as an adaption of this tutorial, following the code and converting it to godot. Then it went on a tangent XD
