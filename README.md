# Godot Actor System

This is a plugin for adding actors and their behaviours into godot

## Plans

- Add support for forgetting to set an export, current behaviour is undesired
- Add liquid bodies and actor behaviour for them
- Add climbing
- Add other actor (rigidbody) Nodes
- Add camera nodes
- Add more Gravity Nodes
- Change how some of the code works, some bits need moving
- Add images and expand README.md

## Installation

Copy the code into your godot project addons folder

## Usage

When adding a node you can add actor into the scene

Add gravity types for the actor to abide by

Add Actor Components to add functionality to the actor

When adding Nodes, do check for the exports and set them accordingly

## Contributing

I am currently not open to contributions. This code is primarily being made for my own learning benefit. This may change in the future once I get the code to a point where I am happy.

 - A lot of the movement code and feature is copied/based/inspired on this tutorial, this project started as an adaption of this tutorial, following the code and converting it to godot. Then it went on a tangent XD
